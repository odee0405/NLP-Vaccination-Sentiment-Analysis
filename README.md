# NLP-Vaccination-Sentiment-Analysis Repository

This repository provides the essential code and resources for participating in the Zindi NLP Challenge titled "To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate." The challenge revolves around creating a machine learning model capable of accurately categorizing sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) in Twitter posts related to vaccination topics. By analyzing public sentiment, the solution aims to assist public health organizations and policymakers in formulating effective strategies for vaccine communication and promotion.

## Challenge Overview

As efforts are underway to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, monitoring public sentiment toward vaccinations becomes paramount. This challenge involves the classification of Twitter posts into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments regarding vaccinations.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises labeled Twitter posts, each assigned a sentiment label (-1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive). Inside the `data` folder, you'll find the following files:
- `Train.csv`: Labeled tweets for training the model.
- `Test.csv`: Tweets for model testing.
- `SampleSubmission.csv`: Example submission format.

## Approach

1. Data Preprocessing: Tasks like tokenization, lowercase conversion, special character removal, etc.
2. Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model.
3. Fine-Tuning: Training the model on the training dataset.
4. Validation: Assessing the model's performance using the validation set.
5. Gradio App: Developing a user-friendly interface for the model using Gradio.
6. Model Deployment: Uploading the model and pipeline to the HuggingFace platform.
7. Dockerization: Containerizing the Gradio app for cloud deployment.

## Getting Started
### 1. Installing the Required Packages
Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Step-by-Step Guidance
Follow the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder for detailed instructions.

Explore the `app` folder for the Gradio app code and the `docker` folder for Docker-related files.

## Usage

- Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
- Navigate to the `app` folder and run the Gradio app:
  ```bash
  cd app
  python app.py
  ```
- For cloud deployment, refer to the Dockerization instructions in the `docker` folder.
